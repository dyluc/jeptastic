### Ahoy!

This is just a dump for my own reference of JEPs and new features of the newest JDKs that I find most interesting.

It also will include / includes usages of early access builds including features in preview and incubation, as well as other projects they are working on at Oracle (Loom, Panama, Valhalla, etc).

I may also add some reference here in the future to using JDK Mission Control (JMC) and its latest releases, but I'm not sure yet.

Find the latest ready for use, early access and reference implementation all the way back to SE 7 [here](https://jdk.java.net).
