    /**
     * JEP 338: Vector API (Incubator) - Express vector operations that reliably compile at runtime to optimal vector hardware instructions on supported CPU architectures
     * for better performance to equivalent scalar operations.
     *
     * JEP 357: Migrate from Mercurial to Git - OpenJDK source code has been migrated from Mercurial to Git
     * JEP 369: Migrate to GitHub - OpenJDK source code hosted on GitHub.
     *
     * JEP 380: Unix-Domain Socket Channel - A Unix-Domain socket is an IPC mechanism that allows bidirectional data exchange between processes running on the same machine,
     * as opposed to over a network (IP, TCP/IP sockets). Unix-Domain socket support added to the socket and server-socket channel in java.nio.channels package.
     *
     * JEP 389: Foreign Linker API (Incubator) - Yay! Java access to native code. In conjunction with the Foreign-Memory API (JEP 393), will simplify interaction with native libraries.
     * JEP 393: Foreign-Memory Access API (Third Incubator) - In third incubation, this API allows Java programs to safely and efficiently access foreign memory outside the Java heap.
     *
     * JEP 392: Packaging Tool - jpackage is now a production-ready feature. This tool can be used to create custom self-contained application packages and installers. Used in conjunction
     * with jlink. Since the JDK became modular in JDK 9, jlink has allowed for creating stripped back custom runtime images with only the required modular dependencies.
     *
     * JEP 395: Records - A new type of class acting as a transparent carrier for immutable data.
     * TODO: See JDK 15 notes JEP 384.
     *
     * JEP 397: Sealed Classes (Second Preview) - Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which subclasses and interfaces can extend or implement them.
     * TODO: See JDK 17 notes JEP 409 where this feature has been delivered.
