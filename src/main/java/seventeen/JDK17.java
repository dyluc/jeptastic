     * JEP 412: Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator) - A merging of the Foreign Linker API and the Foreign Memory Access API. This is intended to be a single API for Java programs to
     * access native code and data outside the java runtime (outside of, and not managed by the JVM) in a more efficient and safe manner. Scraps JNI. See JDK 18 JEP 419.
     *
     * JEP 414: Vector API (Second Incubator) - An API to express vector computations that reliably compile to optimal instructions on native architecture. Improved performance. See JDK 18 JEP 417.
